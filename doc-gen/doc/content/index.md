  * Bi-directional RPC calls from client to server and server to client.
  * SSL socket layer encryption option.
  * Data Compression option.
  * RPC call cancellation.
  * RPC call timeout.
  * Out-of-Band RPC server replies to client.
  * Non RPC Protocol Buffer messaging for peer to peer communication.
  * Protocol Buffer wire protocol.
  * Semantics for calls handling on TCP connection closure.
  * Pluggable logging facility.
